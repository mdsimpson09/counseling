Being neurodivergent means having a brain that operates differently from what is considered typical or neurotypical. While neurodivergence is not inherently negative, it can bring significant challenges and frustrations. It may feel as though everyone else has access to an unspoken rulebook for socializing and interacting that you were never given.
